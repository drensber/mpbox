FUTURE:
  Core:
  - Add config section (with firmware upgrade).
  - Migration to TagLib.
  - Leverage busybox as much as possible (init, for example).
  - Change player to mplayer .
  - Migrate to git.
  - mps-librarydbd:shmfile_param... name change?
  - librarydbd: improve handling of readdir and opendir so that errors 
    can be recovered from.
  - Macintosh standalone build.
  - BUG: Why does mDNSResponder die after a few minutes in standalone mode?
  - Add timeout to libmpgserver functions.  Probably makes sense to allow
    for different timeouts for different commands (commands that perform
    actions that rely on file access may take longer than others
    because of sleeping disks, etc.).
  - Add locking to mpgserver functions.
  - Try to figure out why USB keyboard doesn't work on mini-ITX box.
  - BUG: mps-server - "END OF PLAYLIST" state == 99% CPU (intermittent?)!
  Web UI:
  - General UI improvements:
    - Make "add all" work correctly for search and random results.
    - Preserve the state of the most recent "Traditional", "Filename", 
      "Random", and "Search" navigations and revert to them when
      their radio button is clicked. 
    - Cache mps-library requests using an associative array stack.
  - The mouse over "info" thing.
  - Show track time.
  - Fast-Forward, Fast-backward
  - Make Playlist show grouped by Artist/Album headers (and remove by
    group if there are mulitples).
  - Use toLocaleString() to localize.

0.3.0:
  - Migration from uClinux-dist to buildroot
  - Migration from svn to git

0.2.8:
  Revision 248:
  - Upgrade mini-xml 2.7.
  - Make "Cancel" and "Configure" buttons the same font size (need to test).
  - Make mount_media... ping the server before trying to mount (test).

0.2.7:
  Revision 248:
  - Add 'mpb-system' as a shell script.
    - Parameters ipaddr_eth0, netmask_eth0, primary_dns, hostname, 
  - Add 'mps-library get status
    - Parameters number_of_artists, number_of_albums, number_of_titles.
  - Add mps_library_get_artist_count(), mps_library_get_album_count(),
    mps_library_get_title_count()       
  - Create a libmpsserver-shared.c that contains "get_*_int64_value()".
  - Make 'mps-playlist get status' conform to the <param> format.
  - Change 'mps-player get status' to 'mps-player get summary'
    - Only needs "state", "current_playlist_entry_id", 
      "playlist_change_counter", "library_change_counter", 
      "librarydbd_state"
    - With above change, librarydbd no longer needs to keep a running
      count of "number_of_music_files" (that can be queried from SQLite). 
  - Change 'mps-player status' and 'mps-playlist status' so that they have
    the same <param name= value=/> format that mps-config and mps-constants
    have.
  - Change mpsCommand=>mps.  Change mpsCommandGetStatus to mpsPlayerGetStatus.

0.2.6:
  Revision 245:
  - Still had layout problems... Think I finally have it right.

0.2.5 (this one's not particularly good either):
  Revision 242:
  - Forgot to add a line to www's makefile to install the new png files.

0.2.4 (this one is bad! don't use it):
  Revision 240:
  - Make playlist area say <i>EMPTY</i> when the playlist is empty.
  - Force long album names to be truncated so that "add all" doesn't
    get wrapped and obscured (folderNavigatorDiv).
  - Make "autoscroll" not constantly jerk you to the top when
    the database is being populated.
  - If search returns no results, then make it say so.
  - Search should "select all" and set focus when either the text field
    or the radio button are clicked.

0.2.3:
  Revision 238:
  - Search doesn't feel quite right (tie to a different event... "text
    changed"? use "mousedown", but delay the reading of text field?)
  - Make Playlist navigator bounce to the bottom when new song(s) added to  
    the queue.
  - Make Browse By navigator return to the same scroll position that you were 
    previously in when navigating backward.
  - Make Browse By navigator return to the same "top level" result set
    (random, search, or traditional/filename).

0.2.2:
  Revision 236:
  - Make sorting case insensitive and ignore "the".

0.2.1:
  Revision 235:
  - Made "Chooser" stuff periodically update when librarydbd is in the
    "CREATING" state.
    - This included making "number_of_music_files" in library_status get 
      updated.
  - "unique_id" ==> "id"
  - mpeg_shm_region ==> mps_shm_region
  - report librarydbd_state through status part of API

0.2.0:
  Revision 233:
  - UTF-8 validation function should be expanded to:
    - Copy instead of just validate, and copy what it can,
      replacing bad UTF-8 sequences, etc. with '?'
    - shorten long sequences of whitespace to 2 spaces.
    - replace (0x01-0x1f,0x7f) with '?'
  - Fixed :
    BUG: mps-librarydbd weren't always (in the "cache" case) checking whether 
    the 'album' AND 'artist' already exist when deciding whether to create 
    a new 'album' entry.
  - Add radio-button that allows user to change method of browsing 
    (by random, by search).
  - Implement "add n random songs to playlist" using database
  - Make "back" work more like you'd expect (goes to the beginning of the
    presently playing song, unless it's been been < (some threshold)
    since the last button press).
  - Interface to "add random".   

0.1.1:
  Revision 231:
  - Quick fix to the 'invalid ASCII' problem.

0.1.0:
  Revision 229:
  - Add radio-button that allows user to change method of browsing (by 
    filesystem, by tag).
  - Remove media_mount_point_dir from mpservice_constants.xml
  - Change the "favico" thing to say something to the effect of
    "mpservice" rather than "netmp".

0.0.4:
  Revision 227:
  - Really stupid bug (left some smbmnt1_ stuff around).

0.0.3:
  Revision 225:
  - Needed to add media_dir__0___mountpoint (it IS actually necessary).

0.0.2:
  Revision 222:
  - Make "startups.sh" script in standalone installation check that
    "media_dir__0" actually exists.
  - MPBOX_BUILD_TARGET ==> MPSERVICE_BUILD_PLATFORM
  - Get rid of the "smbmnt" stuff, since I don't want to be so smb
    specific at the core.  Figure out what to do about the "smbmnt1_subdir" 
    thing (maybe just remove it).  (*** CONFIG CHANGE ***)
      media_mount_dir__0__ ==> media_dir__0
      smbmnt1_servername ==> media_dir__0__servername
      ADD media_dir__0__servertype (cifs, nfs, etc)
      smbmnt1_mountpoint ==> media_dir__0__servervolume
      smbmnt1_options ==> media_dir__0__mountoptions
      smbmnt1_subdir ==> NULL (disappears because subdir is in "dir")
  - Make names of processes and directories (mpg != mpgs) consistent,
    and use "mps" instead (*** CONFIG CHANGE *** (tables now "mps_")).
  - Make upgrade_firmware use /tmp as scratch area rather than the
    flash disk.

0.0.1:
  Revision 204:
  - Change versioning scheme.
  - Removed all the damn perl!
  - Break out into "mpservice" (the application), and "mpbox" (the 
    embedded platform).
    - Make a 'make help' target.
    - Make daemons (mpg-server, boa, librarydbd, mDNSResponder) read 
      configuration from XML files.
  - Migrate systemConstants.pm stuff to XML
    - Add functions to mpgs API to access the constants and config
      params from XML (probably just an API to access the XML files).
  - Simplify install and make it more distribution neutral for the mpbox/src
    stuff (make the install happen at that level, rather than at the 
    mpbox/Makefile level).

3.0.0_DEV09:
  Revision 180:
  - LIBRARYDB_SCHEMA_VERSION 1 (added id field to 
    mpgs_library_filesystem_status). 
  Revision 159-179:
  - Made build/install system use my makefiles, rather than the
    uClinux-dist "platform" makefile.
  Revision 158:
  - split mpservice into mpservice and mpbox
  Revision 151:
  - changed 'netmp' directory name to 'mpservice'.
  - changec netmp_configuration.xml to mpservice_configuration.xml
3.0.0_DEV08:
  Revision 148:
  - Lots of updates to the svn_thirdparty area.
  Revision 147:
  - Added the externally built Realtek 8168 network driver (the one 
    included in 2.6.39 doesn't work with 2.6.39 for some reason).
  - Removed 'mediadbd'
  Revision 146:
  - Fixed some "%d"->"%ld" compiler warnings.
  - Upgraded to uClinux-dist-20110603 and added a smbmnt1_options field
    in the configuration file to address the issues that came about when 
    Apple changed their SMB implementation.
  Revision 145:
  - Some changes related to building as standalone (mpservice) and in 
    the embedded configuration (mpbox).


3.0.0_DEV07:
  Revision 143:
  - mpgs-librarydbd optimizations:
    - Cached artist_id and album_id so that it doesn't have to be looked
      up in database on successive lookups of the same id.
    - Disabled debug in default build.
    - Created index for the update search that happens during an update.
    - Added a few FOREIGN KEY declarations.
 
3.0.0_DEV06:
  Revision 141:
  - Made several sqlite3 optimizations: 1. Use PRAGMAs cache_size, synchronous, 
    and temp_store.  2. Use TRANSACTION START/END when updating.

3.0.0_DEV05:
  Revision 139:
  - When browsing heirarchically by file, should show the filename in the 
    browser, not the id3tag name.

3.0.0_DEV04:
  Revision 136:
   - Only order folders (not titles) alphabetically.

3.0.0_DEV03:
  Revision 134:
   - Didn't quite get the "order by" thing right. Trying again.

3.0.0_DEV02:
  Revision 132:
   - Added "order by" to the mpgs-library queries;
   - Removed the /disk2 and /playlist tmpfs's.

3.0.0_DEV01:
  - Added libmpg123 stuff to read mp3 file headers.
  - Migrated playlist to sqlite3 implementation rather than the goofy
    symlink /playlist thing
  - Made mpgs-library API use mp3 header tags in addition to file and 
    directory names.
  - Updates mpgs-library API so that it uses file/directory names so that
    it uses database rather than "/disk2".
  - Allow MPGS_DBG_PRINT to be sent to stdout or syslog (see mpgs-librarydbd
    for a good example).   

2.1.0_DEV17:
  - Retry of 2.1.0_DEV16 with mpgs-shmtool Makefile problem fixed.
 
2.1.0_DEV16 (DOESN'T BUILD!):
  Revision 124:
  - Created a tool called mpgs-shmtool that can be used to initialize,
    modify, and view shared memory contents. 
  - Layed most of the groundwork for the mpg-library API that gets things
    from the database, but won't be quite right until next checkin (need
    separate artist & album tables in database)

2.1.0_DEV15:
  Revision 122:
  - Upgrade busybox and build it from netmp/src (add busybox "time" command)
  - Make librarydbd deal with mp3 files that have no title or artist
    in header.  At least make them do an "unknown", or better yet, 
    let them try to guess by path name (but should that be optional?).
    iTunes just files under "unknown artist", "unknown album", and then
    uses the filename as the basis for the title.
    Could also guess by contents (is shazam database public)?
  Revision 121:
  - Optimized (or maybe un-stupified is a better word) the algorithm for
    updating the database.

2.1.0_DEV14 (not sure where 12 and 13 went):
  Revision 119
  - Added mpg-librarydbd (sqlite3 based library database daemon).
    - Changed mediadb.info from raw text to a sqlite3 database.
  - Added mpg-config to migrate /disk1/netmp.conf to XML.
    - Define the format of the XML based config file.
    - Write a utility called "mpgs-config-flatten" that can take an XML based
      config file and turn it into a "<key>=<value>" file than can
      be read by shell scripts.
    - Write a utility called "mpgs-config-get" that can get one value from an 
      XML based config file.
    - Write a utility called "mpgs-config-set" that sets one value in an
      XML based config file.

2.1.0_DEV11:
  Revision 86
  - Changed default shell back to ash (it had gotten checked in as bash
  for some reason.

2.1.0_DEV11:
  Revision 84
  - Added support for Intel D945GSEJT mini-itx board.

  Revision 83:
  - Fixed a build bug that would cause 'ln -s' to fail after more than
    one build
  - Get rid of PERL (interpreter anyway)!!!!

  Revision 82:
  - Change mpg-command to mpgs-player and mpg-playlist to mpgs-playlist

  Revision 81:
  - Change "mediadb" to "library".

  Revision 80:
  - Make 'ajaxstart.html' become 'index.html'  This gets rid of one more 
    level of indirection and one more perl-ism.

  Revision 79:
  - Made "Remove all" only appear when there are items in the playlist.

2.1.0_DEV11:
  Revision 77:
  - Disallowed removal of the track that's currently playing... this 
    is hard to even do, but bad things happen when you do it!
  - Fixed problem where albums with ' characters don't
    work with "add whole album"

2.1.0_DEV10:
  Revision 75:
  Core:
  - mediadbd should just set up a link with the name of the file (no
    extension like ".mp3").  
  - Removed redundant "filename" field in mpg-mediadb.  
    'mpg-playlist add' interface shouldn't need to know
    file_extension or format (this is resolved on the
    back end).
  - playist element structure now contains the more abstract "path"
    instead of "file".
  - "mpg-mediadb get" output header just have "parent" and "name"
    ("name" instead of full "path") javascript functions can figure
    out full path by just adding parent + "/" + name.
  - Moved all of the "file" related stuff to libmpgserver-private.h.  
    (Goal should be that C-API and XML-API users don't need to know
     about specific files).
  UI:
  - Added UI support for "add folder".

  Revision 74:
  - Replace bash with busybox "ash" 
    Ssome of the scripts (maybe just /etc/init.d/net) use some
    of the more advanced "substitution" features in bash. Should be able to
    substitute sed expressions.  For examples, see: 
    http://chrischan.blog-city.com/bash_pattern_substitution.htm
    Also, up/down-arrow history recall in bash doesn't seem to work.  May 
    work in newer versions of busybox.  To upgrade busybox in uclinux, 
    see: 
    http://mailman.uclinux.org/pipermail/uclinux-dev/2010-August/002652.html 
  - Support adding an entire folder with "mpg-playlist add"

2.1.0_DEV09:
  Revision 73:
  - Simplified build for the netmp/src stuff (make the build
    happen at that level, rather than at the NetMP/Makefile level).
  Revision 70:
  - Changed "ADD" to "-->"
  Revision 69:
  - FIXED: When end of playlist has been reached, playlist is displayed as 
    empty.
  - Changed "SKIP" -> "PLAY"

2.1.0_DEV08:
  - Fixed build/dependency issue with 2.1.0_DEV07.

2.1.0_DEV07 - THIS ONE IS BAD - Doesn't build:
  Revision 65:
  - Add a "Playlist last changed" and "Mediadb changed" to the status
    structure.
  - Added the UI changes to update whenever "playlist last changed" changes
    or "mediadb last changed" changes.
  - Allowed MPGS_DBG_PRINT to be compiled out (via DEBUG_ENABLED).  
  Revision 64:
  - Fixed the "repeats the song twice" problem.  It seems to happen right 
    after a "pause".
  - Added an indicator of "End of Playlist has been reached" to the UI.
  - Changed display polling interval from 5000ms to 2500ms.
  Revision 63:
  - Added sqlite3.

2.1.0_DEV06:
  - This one has all of the features listed in DEV04, with the URI encoding
    problem fixed that kept "add to playlist" from working in DEV05.
 
2.1.0_DEV05: - THIS ONE IS BAD - non-latin chars don't work on safari:
  - This one has all of the features listed in DEV04, except that I 
    added the missing file.

2.1.0_DEV04: - THIS ONE IS BAD... I forgot to "svn add one file":
  - Made libraries/includes from mpg123 go into /netmp/lib/ and 
    /netmp/include.
  - Made mpg-mediadbd (and associated C library) return "self" and "parent".
  - Made mpg-playlist return "current_id=" in the header.
  - Made upgrade_firmware script more flash intensive and less memory
    intensive.
  - Got basic AJAX interface to work.
  - Refactor so that bonjour builds under the same structure as all the 
    other 3rd party stuff (and put all of the 3rd party stuff in one place).
  - Got UTF-8 support working!
  - Changed system init and firmware upgrade procedures so that can run in
    a machine with only 64M memory

2.1.0_DEV03:
  - Fixed the build problem that kept 2.1.0_DEV02 from building.

2.1.0_DEV02:  - THIS ONE IS BAD! DOESN'T BUILD.
  - Added MXML library.
  - Added XML option to all "mpg-" commands.
  - Moved the common stuff for "mpg-" commands into mpg-command-shared.c
  - Added beginnings of a AJAX UI (still more or less unusable).

2.1.0_DEV01:
  - Upgraded from Snapgear 3.5 to uClinux-dist-20100315

  - Doing above resulted in:
    - Since kernel 2.6.28, probing for directly attached IDE controllers is
      no longer the default behavior, so I'm now doing ide drivers as modules 
      now so that the 'ide-generic probe_mask=0x01' option can be used.
    - The sound driver has changed such that the Via target now needs 
      different mixer settings.
    - Can now use the perl and samba that are part of the uClinux dist, 
      so I don't need to graft them on (but still ahve to add perl URI mod).

2.0.0_DEV06:
  - Implement the mediadb access routines

  - Add number-field validation to commands.

  - change mpgs_player_play_absolute to take an int rather than string argument

  - related to previous, need to change perl scripts to use new "MPGS_" strings instead of "NULL", "BEGINNING", and "END".

  - Added real functions for the c-library playlist insert, remove, etc.

  - Make mpg-player deal with entry_id's that are shifted underneath it's feet.


2.0.0_DEV05:
  - changed the internal representation of the 5 digit file identifier from string to int.
  - Added shell functions for the c-library playlist insert, remove, etc.


2.0.0_DEV04:
  - Upgraded to mpg123 1.10.0, and reworked the control plane to use the shared memory architecture.

svn revision 39:
  - fixed linux/limits.h problem in snapgear build system.

2.0.0_DEV03:

 - Fixed issue where lines in mediadb.txt started with /netshare1 rather than /disk2.  This keeps "add random" features from working correctly.
